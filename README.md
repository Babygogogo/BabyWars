However, the game is far from being complete and no release is published so far.
If you want to have a try, feel free to email to 101599838@qq.com, and I will send you the win32 binary files.

## Contribution
The game uses cocos2d-lua v3.9 as its engine, which is cross-platform, so you can develop the game on most destop platforms.

A typical way to setup the development environment:

1. Download the engine and unzip it
- Create an empty lua project using the tools in the engine and compile it (for details, reach for the documents of the engine)
- Download the files of this project, then copy them to the project above, overwriting the existing files
